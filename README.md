## 🏢 Overview

PropertyAssistAI is an intelligent assistant for real estate professionals that handles client inquiries, property information, and CRM updates. Built with modern AI technologies, this system provides human-like conversation capabilities while maintaining sub-second response times.


## 🚀 Key Features

- **High-Performance Chat**: Response times under 1 second for all user interactions
- **Intelligent RAG System**: Contextual, accurate answers about properties and real estate topics
- **CRM Integration**: Seamless synchronization with SalesForce Real Estate Cloud
- **Multi-Channel Support**: Web widget, WhatsApp, and voice interfaces
- **GDPR Compliance**: European data protection standards built-in

## 🔧 Technology Stack

This project demonstrates expertise in:

- **AI/ML**: LangChain, GPT-4, RAG architectures, sentence transformers
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, asyncio with performance optimization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient vector search
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Integration**: OAuth2, webhooks, RESTful API design
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana dashboards for real-time metrics

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Average Response Time | 0.78s | 95th percentile under 1s |
| Concurrent Users | 500+ | Tested under load |
| Monthly Active Users | 35,000+ | Across multiple agencies |
| Uptime | 99.7% | Since production deployment |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a modern, scalable architecture:

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/mwaqas-sudo/property-assist-AI/blob/main/assets/architecture-diagram.svg)

Key components:
- Optimized RAG pipeline for property knowledge retrieval
- In-memory caching layer for frequent queries
- Asynchronous processing for CRM updates
- Containerized microservices for easy scaling

## 💻 Code Examples

### High-Performance Response Handling

```python
async def process_message(self, message: Message, conversation_id: str) -> ConversationResponse:
    """Process user message with sub-second response time."""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Try cache first for immediate response
    cache_key = f"conv:{conversation_id}:msg:{message.content}"
    cached_response = await self.cache.get(cache_key)
    if cached_response:
        return cached_response
    
    # Use timeout to ensure response time SLA
    try:
        response = await asyncio.wait_for(
            self._generate_response(message.content),
            timeout=0.8  # 800ms timeout
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        # Fall back to faster response generation
        response = await self._generate_fallback_response(message.content)
    
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    logger.info(f"Processed in {process_time:.3f}s")
    
    return response
```

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- **Vector Search Optimization**: Custom indexing strategies reduced query times by 65%
- **Context Management**: Careful prompt engineering improved response quality while reducing token usage
- **Caching Strategy**: Implementing a multi-level cache reduced API calls to external services by 78%
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Zero-downtime updates enabled continuous improvement without service interruption

## 🔄 CRM Integration Flow

The system connects seamlessly with SalesForce Real Estate Cloud:

1. **Lead Detection**: Natural language processing identifies potential leads during conversation
2. **Data Extraction**: Contact information and preferences extracted through conversational AI
3. **Async Updates**: Background tasks update CRM without blocking user interaction
4. **Webhook Notifications**: Real-time alerts notify agents of high-priority leads
5. **Bi-Directional Sync**: Changes in CRM reflected in conversation context
